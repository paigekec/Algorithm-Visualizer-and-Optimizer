# Algorithm-Visualizer-and-Optimizer

## Project Overview
This project implements and visualizes classic algorithms such as sorting, searching, pathfinding, and optimization algorithms. Users can interactively see how algorithms work and compare their performance on different datasets.

## Features
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort
- **Searching Algorithms**: Binary Search, Linear Search
- **Pathfinding Algorithms**: Dijkstra's Algorithm, A* Search
- **Optimization Algorithms**: Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms

## Technologies Used
- **Python** for algorithm implementation.
- **Matplotlib/Pygame** for algorithm visualization.
- **timeit/cProfile** for performance benchmarking.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Algorithm-Visualizer-and-Optimizer.git
